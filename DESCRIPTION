Description: Designing surveys require relevant datasets to be used as basis for
    sample size calculations, sampling design, survey planning/logistics and
    survey implementation. These include datasets on population, lists of 
    sampling clusters, map datasets for spatial sampling, and previous survey 
    datasets that can be used for estimating indicator variance and design 
    effects. This package contains relevant datasets for use in designing 
    surveys in Liberia.
